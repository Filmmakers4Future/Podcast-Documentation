# Hardware

## Computer
You need a computer running Windows, macOS or Linux.

## Audio Interface
An audio interface is required for the recording. The easiest way is to use a USB microphone. If you are in Germany or the surrounding area we will happily send you one. But in principle everything that can be used for Skype or similar applications works as well.


## Alternative
If you do not have the possibility to access a computer with an audio interface, we can also do the recording with an iOS or Android device. Please have a look at [Mobile Recording](/mobile/app.html) for details.
